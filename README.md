## System requirements

For this course you need the following tools on your machine:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Anaconda 2019.10](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After you've set up the requirements, you're ready to watch the slides and
try out the labs in this course.

## Viewing the slides

We've stored all the materials as reveal.js slidedecks in this repository.
To watch the slides, follow these steps.

1. First, clone the repository to disk.
2. Next, install revelation with the command `pip install revelation`
3. Then, run the command `revelation start slides/<module-name>/slides.md`
   to start the presentation.

## Running the labs

Please navigate to the folder `labs` to find the labs for this course.
We've split the labs into various subfolders that match the hours in the
table of contents above.

## For the trainer

This course uses `reveal.js` through the `revelation` python package.
You can use the <kbd>S</kbd> in any presentation to pull up the speaker notes.

Every slide deck takes 60 minutes to work through. A pacing timer is included
so you have an idea how fast you're going to through the materials.
