# LAB 3 - Setting up your project with cookiecutter templates

In this lab we'll explore the data science cookie cutter template.
We'll cover the following topics:

- Installing cookiecutter
- Creating a new project using cookiecutter
- Converting an existing project

Note, this lab doesn't have a predefined solution.
You're encouraged to try different solutions and see how things work for yourself.

At the end of the lab, we'll discuss the solution with others in the classroom.

Let's get started

## Step 1: Installing cookiecutter

Before you can start your project, you will need the `cookiecutter` tool.
Install `cookiecutter` using the following command inside an anaconda prompt:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

## Step 2: Start a new project

In an empty folder, execute the following command to start a new data science project:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your project.

## Step 3: Converting an existing project

In the previous labs you've worked on a data analysis job and a machine learning job.
Take one of these projects, and try to fit them in the template.

Feel free to ask others for help, and discuss what you would choose as your solution
for making the necessary scripts inside the data science project!
