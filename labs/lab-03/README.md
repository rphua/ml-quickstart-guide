# LAB 3 - Setting up your project with cookiecutter templates

In this lab we'll explore the data science cookie cutter template.
We'll cover the following topics:

- Installing cookiecutter
- Creating a new project using cookiecutter
- Converting an existing project

Note, this lab doesn't have a predefined solution.
You're encouraged to try different solutions and see how things work for yourself.

At the end of the lab, we'll discuss the solution with others in the classroom.

Let's get started

## Step 1: Installing cookiecutter

Before you can start your project, you will need the `cookiecutter` tool.
Install `cookiecutter` using the following command inside an anaconda prompt:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

## Step 2: Start a new project

In an empty folder, execute the following command to start a new data science project:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your project.

## Step 3: Converting an existing project

In the previous lab you've worked on creating a regression model.
Take this project, and try to fit it in the template using the online manual.

Feel free to ask others for help, and discuss what you would choose as your solution
for making the necessary scripts inside the data science project!
